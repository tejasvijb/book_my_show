# book_my_show
Bookmyshow is a ticketing platform where you can book tickets for a movie show. The project represents sql schemas, tables and examples entries


## Steps to schema design

### 1. Create tables
    Find out all the nouns
    After identifyiing the noun do we need to store any data related to this noun
    if yes, create a table
  
### 2. Add Primary key and all other attributes
    Pk is unique and small in size
    It should rarely change

### 3. Finalize the relationships (Using cardinality)
    Cardinality - When two things are related to each other how many of one thing is related to how many of the other thing
